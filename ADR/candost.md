# ADR-XXX: Title
Status: Draft, In Discussion, Decided, Implemented, Abandoned, Superseded Authors: Decision Date:

## Context / Problem
// Define the problem and explain the context driving the decision. What was the need? Link your text with relevant materials. Don’t write a novel; keep it as short as possible but as long as necessary.

## Decision & Rationale
// Explain your decision in one sentence. Then, explain your rationale in bullet points—focus on why you made this decision.

## (Expected or Known) Consequences
// Explicitly list down the consequences. If you can, also think and write about the consequences of consequences (second-order thinking).

## Considered Options (and why they haven’t been chosen?)
// List down all the other options you considered with their pros/and cons. Explain in one sentence why didn’t you choose that option.

## Appendix / References
// Add additional materials that can give more context or are relevant to the decision.

Update Log: (not needed if the ADRs are committed to the repository)
// After the ADR moves out of Draft status, log changes here. A good analogy for this log is having them as meaningful commit messages.
