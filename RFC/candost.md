Status: Draft, Collecting Feedback, Accepted, Rejected, Abandoned Authors: Feedback Deadline: Last Update Date:

## Need (Context / Problem)

## Approach
// How are you planning to satisfy the need defined above? The explanation should be as detailed as necessary to fulfill the need.

## Pros & Cons
// What are the benefits of the proposed approach? Focus on the factual benefits rather than personal points of view.

## Alternatives (and why arenâ€™t they the chosen one)
// Write down at least two alternatives together with their pros and cons.

## Appendix / References
// Add additional materials that can give more context or are relevant to the decision.

## Update Log:
